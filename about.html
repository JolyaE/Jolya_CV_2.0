                <h2>A little about me!</h2>
                <p>I'm a high school senior with an interest in programming and software engineering. I enjoy learning new concepts in computer science and spending time working on projects that help me grow my skills. Outside of that, I like traditional art, especially oil pastels. I've also worked with live cameras through my district's football video internship for two years. Additionally, I was a part of my school's graphic design print shop as an intern, Inkspire Prints, for two years. I graduated early to focus more on learning and growing my skills, and start college in software engineering in Fall 2026.</p>
